When declaring the dependencies in `package.json` files in Node project, we need to pay attention to version numbers - there are many different ways to specify the version number for dependencies which you want to use.

Here are a few examples.

* 4.8.5
* >4.8.5
* >=4.8.5
* ~4.8.5

You may have read through some tutorials where they will declare dependencies with some characters and a version number and wonder what exactly does that mean?

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool111  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.


|-----------------+------------+-----------------+----------------|
| Default aligned |Left aligned| Center aligned  | Right aligned  |
|-----------------|:-----------|:---------------:|---------------:|
| First body part |Second cell | Third cell      | fourth cell    |
| Second line     |foo         | **strong**      | baz            |
| Third line      |quux        | baz             | bar            |
|-----------------+------------+-----------------+----------------|

### Code, with syntax highlighting

Code blocks use the [solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme. Both the light and
dark versions are included, so you can swap them out easily. _Solarized Dark_ is the default.

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "name": "awesome-sauce",
  "main": "server.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.0.x" <-- what in the world is that?!
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

# Headings!

They're responsive, and well-proportioned (in `padding`, `line-height`, `margin`, and `font-size`).
They also heavily rely on the awesome utility, [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/).

##### They draw the perfect amount of attention

This allows your content to have the proper informational and contextual hierarchy. Yay.

### There are lists, too

  * Apples
  * Oranges
  * Potatoes
  * Milk

  1. Mow the lawn
  2. Feed the dog
  3. Dance

### Images look great, too

### There are also pretty colors

Also the result of [BASSCSS](http://www.basscss.com/), you can <span class="bg-dark-gray white">highlight</span> certain components
of a <span class="red">post</span> <span class="mid-gray">with</span> <span class="green">CSS</span> <span class="orange">classes</span>.

I don't recommend using blue, though. It looks like a <span class="blue">link</span>.

### Stylish blockquotes included

You can use the markdown quote syntax, `>` for simple quotes.

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Suspendisse quis porta mauris.

However, you need to inject html if you'd like a citation footer. I will be working on a way to
hopefully sidestep this inconvenience.

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
  </p>
  <footer><cite title="Antoine de Saint-Exupéry">Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</cite></footer>
</blockquote>

### There's more being added all the time

Checkout the [Github repository](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) to request,
or add, features.

Happy writing.
